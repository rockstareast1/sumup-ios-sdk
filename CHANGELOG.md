## Transition Guide to 3.0

When improving imported Swift names we took the opportunity to rename
and prefix some classes and enums. We've also renamed the SDK to
SumUpSDK to make it easier to integrate with CocoaPods.
Migrating your code base is easy.

* Remove the `SumupSDK.embeddedframework` and add the new
  one called `SumUpSDK.embeddedframework`. Make sure your target still links
  against the framework and still copies the resource bundle.
* Rename your imports `<SumupSDK/SumupSDK.h>` to `<SumUpSDK/SumUpSDK.h>`
  * If your project uses modules, you can use `@import SumUpSDK;` in Objective-C
  * Swift projects should always use `import SumUpSDK` instead global bridging header imports
* Rename all occurrences of `SumUpCompletionBlock` to `SMPCompletionBlock`
* In ObjC:
  - rename all case-sensitive occurrences of
  `SumupSDK` to `SMPSumUpSDK` (except for imports, see above),
* In Swift:
  - rename all case-sensitive occurrences of `SumupSDK` and `SMPSumupSDK`
  to `SumUpSDK`
  - remove trailing parantheses from `SumUpSDK`'s `isLoggedIn`,
  `checkoutInProgress`, `bundleVersion `, and `bundleVersionShortString`
  - rename `SMPSkipScreenOptions` to `SkipScreenOptions`
